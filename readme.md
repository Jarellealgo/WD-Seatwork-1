## Overview

This project is a simple seatwork created for the Web Development course. It demonstrates the foundational concepts of building a webpage with semantic HTML and styling it using CSS.

### Guiding Questions:
- **What is the project?**  
  A basic webpage using HTML5 and CSS3 that displays images and styled text.
  
- **What's the purpose?**  
  To apply layout principles, image placement, and basic styling in a structured file format.

- **What are the key components?**  
  The project includes an `index.html` and a `style.css` file, along with a folder of images.

- **What technology is used and how is it used?**  
  - HTML structures the content.
  - CSS applies styling, layout, and basic visual aesthetics.

### Key Components

- Single Page Website
- Visual styling using external CSS
- Organized file and folder structure

### Technology

![CSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/CSS-1572B6?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white)

## Rules, Practices and Principles

1. Always use `WD-` in front of the project title for naming conventions.
2. Use `index.html` as the main page; do not rename it.
3. Organize assets properly (images in `images/`, CSS in separate files).
4. File naming should follow camelCase:
   - Example: `buttonStyle.css`
5. Use only **external CSS**—no inline or internal styles.
6. Folder names must describe their purpose.
7. Suggested File Structure:
```
WD-Seatwork-1
├── images
│ ├── apple.png
│ └── background.png
├── index.html
└── style.css

yaml
Copy
Edit
```
